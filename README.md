This project is about building an app with Android Studio and Kotlin to organize my home bar, step by step. Iâ€™m creating it specifically to make use of an old tablet, turning it into a dedicated drink organizer.

From setting up the project to running the first version, this repository shows the practical process of building the app, including real challenges and solutions. It follows a 4-part YouTube series, where each video covers a specific part of the development process.
